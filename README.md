Peacekeeper
===========

Plugins for the Peacekeeper bot located in the *#mnfh* and *#orchestralarmy* channels on the freenode IRC network.

If you have any issues which you would like addressed I recommend you go [here](https://github.com/freshpotatoe/peacekeeper/issues)

##Notes

- Although this bot welcomes contribution all changes are up to the discretion of the #mnfh ops, so just because you have put forward a suggestion does *not* mean that it will be implemented.
- This bot is not developed actively, all development is done both on demand and in the free time of all developers.
